abstract: >-
  Given human (hg19 or hg38) or mouse (mm9 or mm10) based
  genomic region sets (i.e., region sets) and/or (ranked)
  gene sets of interest and respective background
  region/gene sets, the enrichment of terms within the
  configured databases is determined using LOLA, GREAT,
  GSEApy (over-representation analysis (ORA) & preranked
  GSEA), pycisTarget, RcisTarget, before aggregation and
  visualization.
